* Needed to cut a bit of plastic because of how the wires attached to the battery. It was a simple mod and the battery works well.

Broke the digitzer when opening the Tomtom and needed to replace it:

* Video is missing some important points:
  
  * The digitizer is glued to the front frame and it's difficult to remove.
  * I needed to use a hair dryer to heat and then push it out of the frame (in pieces)
  * The digitizer needs to be glued or held in place with double sided electronic tape - I tried to glue it but that didn't work too well so I cleaned off the glue and replaced it with thin double sided tape.
  * For next time, I would try to fing a digitizer with the front frame or buy the tape that is already the shape of the frame. It was a big pain to cut the tape to the right size.
  
* Replacement from AliExpress:

  * The black frame doesn't perfectly line up with the screen but I only notice it because I installed it.
  * The back plastic film was a bit cloudy compared to the original so the viewing angle is narrower than the original.
